In Calculator project i used two dependencies:
- commons-io 2.6 for FileUtils.class,
- junit-jupiter-api 5.8.0-M1 to create unit tests.
I also used two plugins in Maven to create a jar that will allow you to open project by terminal.

Instruction how to open Calculator project by terminal:
- extract
- open terminal in main directory of project
- type command: "java -jar Calculator.jar"

File "instruction.txt" is in path: "src/main/resources". In this file you can change calculator operations.
